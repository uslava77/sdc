      "description": "On April 26th, 2025 the Filipino community in Vancouver, BC faced an abhorrent tragedy as many people lost their lives or injured from such a despicable act. Being neighbors and PNW family, we could not sit here and do nothing to help/show support to our Filipino and Vancouver brothers and sisters. This is our answer to lend a hand of comfort in a time of pain.\n\nPlease join us for the #KapwaStrong Fundraiser Battle for the Filipino Community of Vancouver.\n\nAll proceeds will be donated to Filipino BC, to find out more about this organization or to donate if you can’t make it to the event visit https://filipinobc.com\n\n2 vs 2 Bboy Battle \nDate: June 7th, 2025\nDoors Open: 5 pm\nAdmission (suggested donation): $20\nVenue: Seattle Vineyard\n4142 Brooklyn Ave NE\nSeattle, WA 98105\n\nDJ: Erv (Illaskan Assassins, Anchorage AK)\n\nAs a scene that has been influenced by many of our Filipino artists, it’s fitting to give back to them. Shoutout to the Seattle Vineyard Church for donating the space as well!\n\n“Pag may hirap, may ginhawa” - when there is hardship, there is also relief.\n\n#bboy #community #bcstrong #vancouver #seattle #dance #filipino #fundraiser #battle #pnw #lapulapu #unity #breakdance #donation"
